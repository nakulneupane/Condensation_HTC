# 📘 Condensation Heat Transfer Coefficient Predictor


---

## 📄 Overview

The **Condensation Heat Transfer Coefficient Predictor** is an interactive web application built using **Streamlit**. It enables researchers, engineers, and thermal scientists to:

* Predict condensation heat transfer coefficients (HTC) for a wide range of refrigerants and fluid combinations.
* Input and calculate thermophysical properties using **CoolProp** or provide them manually.
* Leverage advanced **machine learning** (XGBoost + Optuna + PCA) models trained on empirical datasets.
* Upload bulk data for batch processing.
* Interact with a **Google Gemini AI Assistant** for contextual help.
* Toggle between **light** and **dark UI themes**.

## Core Features

### 1. HTC Prediction (Single & Multiple Data Points)

* Predicts the HTC using a trained XGBoost model with PCA for dimensionality reduction.
* Offers **manual input** or **automatic property calculation** (via CoolProp).

### 2. Fluid Property Handling

* Calculate key properties like density, viscosity, thermal conductivity, surface tension, etc.
* Supports **binary mixtures** with mass fractions using CoolProp’s `HEOS` backend.

### 3. Batch Processing (Multiple Data Mode)

* Upload Excel or CSV files for HTC prediction over multiple data entries.
* Returns a downloadable Excel file with HTC predictions appended.

### 4. Visualization

* Generate and download **scatter plots** based on predicted or uploaded data.

## How to Use the App

### 🔹 Initial Setup

1. Deploy the app locally or via **Streamlit Cloud**.

### 🔹 Launch Modes

* **Single Data Point**
  Input all thermophysical values for one fluid condition.

* **Multiple Data**
  Upload `.xlsx` or `.csv` file with bulk entries for batch prediction.

### 🔹 Options for Fluid Property Input

* **CoolProp-based**: Auto-calculate using pressure/temperature + quality.
* **Manual**: Direct user input for all properties.
